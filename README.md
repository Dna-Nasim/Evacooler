# Evacooler
A prototype of air cooler based on evaporative cooling approach. 

This project was done being inspired by several researches conducted at differetn parts of the globe. Considering the hot and humid weather scenario of Bangladesh, Evacooler was designed to be a sigh of relief. The setup has a total capacity of 90 liters of water. If 8-10 liters of ice is mixed with the water, EVACOOLER will keep the temperature down by 4 - 6 degree Celsius depending on the relative humidity. Such setup can keep the ambiance of a 121 sq. ft. room cool for six hours. 

EVACOOLER has its own vascular system to wet the filters (cellulose pad). The prototype is covered with synthetic leather so that the room, where the cooler is kept, does not lose its aesthetic appeal.

There are two sorts of design files in this repository. One of them "Acrylic model" contains the structural design of the air cooler while the other "Leather cut" contains the layout of the leather-cut which is later used to wrap the prototype and give an aesthetic look.
